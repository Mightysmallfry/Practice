'''
A triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles
or scalene. All 3 sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length. An isosceles
triangle has two sides that are the same length, and a third side that is a different
length. If all of the sides have different lengths then the triangle is scalene.
Write a program that reads the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle from the user.
Display a message indicating the type of the triangle.

#Find The side lengths for the triangle
triangle_side = [0,0,0]

triangle_side[0] = input("What is the first side length?")
triangle_side[1] = input("What is the second side length?")
triangle_side[2] = input("What is the third side length?")

#Try comparing side lengths first

same = False

for i in range (3):
    if triangle_side[i] == triangle_side[i+1] 


#Do trigonometry to find angles second

#Based on the angle determine what kind of triangle they are.
